Scoring system of non-achieving CCyR on second-generation TKIs in third line therapy CP
CML
Prognostic factor
Score
Age at start of 3rd line TKI (per 10 years)
1
Absence of CyR on 1st line or 2nd line TKI
8
Absence of CyR prior to 3rd line TKI
7
The assessment of probability of not achieving CCyR according to total score.
After calculation the total score for each patient we divided the patients into two groups: the low
risk (total score ≤10, the high risk (total score ≥11) The patients of the high-risk group had
significantly lower rate of achieving CCyR on third line TKI compared low-risk ,
